Nautilus Photo Tags Management
===================

These scripts allow to handle some simple tag modification on photos straight from Nautilus.

I've written these simple scripts to easily tag, rename, sort and order some holidays photos.

With these scripts you can :
  * Update main tags (date, title, description, city, country, keyword and author)
  * Select a time shift and apply it to creation date tag
  * Set filesystem date according to creation date tag
  * Rename file according to its creation date, country and city tags

All these operations can be done on a specific photo or a group of photos (mass-tagging).

To install the complete environment, just run **tags-install.sh**
