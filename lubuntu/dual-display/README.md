These scripts allow to switch from single display to dual display with a simple key stroke.

This helps as under LUbuntu trusty, screen detection is quite buggy.

Just download and run dual-display-install.sh

After new reboot, you'll be able to switch from single to dual display setting with :
  * Win + 1 : Single display
  * Win + 2 : Dual display
